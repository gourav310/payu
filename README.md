Initial data = json0 for comments at first level

               json1 fro nested comments 

there are 3 leveles of comment possible

all comments will show all the commments 

comment0 is for nested commments & nested at level3

this web app is responsive to most of the devices

reply functionality is not working as of now due to time constraint i was not able to completely implement it

delete , like, edit is working fine
